# Solution Overview

## **Ownership Centralization**

Currently, AI technologies are owned by the most powerful tech companies. The data is contributed by everyone but only the biggest companies retain the most financial benefits.

## **Privileged Access**

Only the most privileged ones have access to the large AI models. The model development is controlled by organizations with the most resources. The mass public does not have control over the AI technology development.

## **Government Censorship**

AI technology development is at the risk of government censorship. It is imperative to have a decentralized platform for everyone to develop, contribute and earn in the process of AI development.
