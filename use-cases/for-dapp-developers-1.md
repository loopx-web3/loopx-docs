# For Data Owners

There are two types of data:

* Web3 data published by Web3 data analytics platforms, and
* Web2 data shared by users in a privacy preserving manner.

## Data Reward Mining

Anyone can contribute on-chain or off-chain data to the network and earn network token rewards. The data storage, access and learning are privacy preserving with:

* zero knowledge proofs,
* privacy preserving machine learning, and
* federated learning of cohorts.
