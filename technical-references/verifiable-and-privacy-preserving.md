## Verifiable AI

Zero-knowledge proofs has their ability to succinctly represent and verify arbitrary programs. ZK is used to verify a) indeed the right model is applied, b) no arbitrary biases exist for different users, and c) external party's signatures are correct when integrating with a LooopX network model or on-chain smart contracts.

## Privacy Preserving AI

Privacy preserving AI is to preserve user privacy and Personally Identifiable Data (PID) data in particular, through federated learning, homomorphic Encryption, and differential privacy. In LoopX Network initial implementation, differential privacy (DP) and federated learning of cohorts (FLoC) are adopted to prevent inference about any single individual's PID data.

All the above solutions are subject to upgrades with the future technology advancements.
