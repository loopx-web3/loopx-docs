# Token Utility

## Governance Token

The LoopX Network token is a governance token with time-weighted voting and value accrual mechanisms. As a token holder, you can:

* Facilitate on-chain governance - LoopX Network token holders could use their tokens to participate in the governance of the project including proposing referenda, electing council members, and voting.
* Use token to pay for gas fees - When users trade on decentralized exchanges, there are gas fees that come along with smart contract execution. LoopX Network tokens can be used to pay these fees.
* Incentivizing network participants and powering the mechanics around the creation of a decentralized node infrastructure on which the platform can run.
