## Web3 Data Intelligence is Missing

Todayâ€™s blockchain world is dominated by smart contract solution with proof of stake for scalability. Yet, the smart contract is limited to very simple operations and in lack of decentralized data support.

LoopX Network is a decentralized Web3 data intelligence infrastructure in which users can plug in their local data together with public onchain and offchain data. More enriched decentralized applications and secure multichain Web3 ecosystem can be built on top of it. User behaviors, wallet profiles and protocol forensics are learned and propagated in the network in a privacy preserving manner to empower data driven DApps and build digital asset security and risk management.

## LoopX Fills This Gap

LoopX builds the fundamental Web3 data intelligence layer for onchain security, digital asset management, next generation social networking, targeted user growth, decentralized Web3 content distribution, identity, reputation, personalized recommendation and fully decentralized data ownership. Data ownership is given back to users, while data analytics and intelligence capacities are maintained by LoopX Network in a fully decentralized manner. The learned behaviors are accessible through smart contracts in LoopX network or any other blockchain in privacy preserving manner.

## A Censorship Resistant Future for Data Applications

LoopX AI network is to provide censorship resistance, public access and ownership for the AI development. It is a hardware coordination layer for compute resources and data intelligence layer for AI development coordination.



## **Ownership Centralization**

Currently, AI technologies are owned by the most powerful tech companies. The data is contributed by everyone but only the biggest companies retain the most financial benefits.

## **Privileged Access**

Only the most privileged ones have access to the large AI models. The model development is controlled by organizations with the most resources. The mass public does not have control over the AI technology development.

## **Government Censorship**

AI technology development is at the risk of government censorship. It is imperative to have a decentralized platform for everyone to develop, contribute and earn in the process of AI development.
