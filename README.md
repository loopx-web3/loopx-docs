# Limited Data Access On-chain

## DApps Beyond Tokens

Todayâ€™s Web3 DApps are mainly built around tokens. There are numerous protocols and applications built on top of tokens: exchanges, wallets, NFTs, lending, liquidity pools and so on. Everything is built around asset management, trading and value sharing of tokens. Tokens are the main theme of DApp building in the past decade. This is due to the constraints of the current blockchain ecosystem:

* smart contracts supporting only very simple operations,
* DApp data access limited to price oracles onchain (e.g., Chainlink & Pyth Network), and
* missing large scale computations like analytics and AI predictions.

It is in desperate need to provide comparable Web2 data availability for the next-gen data driven Web3 DApps.

## Enriched  Data Access

Mainly three categories of data lay the Web2 application foundations: identity, personalization and riskk. To build a more enriched data driven Web3 ecosystem, the following data are critical to rebuild Internet on-chain:

* Identity: It defines user profiles with user value scores, credit scores, and interest tags.
* Personalization: It formulates the relationships between users and items. Items include but are not limited to news, tokens, NFTs, products, and other users.
* Risk: It entails fraud detection, early prevention and risk management. Such data are not&#x20;

All the above three kinds of data are missing on-chain.
