# Inconsistent Web3 Data Retrieval

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/Group 75.png" alt="" data-size="original">

The current Web3 data are messy, inconsistent and incomplete. This is illustrated from the following three perspectives.

## Data Sources

The current Web3 data sources are scattered and not verified. The raw data like wallet token balances can even be different by different data providers. To build reliable data sources, it is important to validate data across multiple data sources before being used by DApps.

## Data Schema

Data schema defines the structure of data for the DApp usages. For Web2 companies, usually they define clear, consistent and easy to understand data schema for backend services, data pipelines, AI models and applications. The Web3 data schema shall be unified for DApps.

## Computation Standard

Data computations are hard yet easy to be standardized. For example, analytics rely on aggregation logic such as "total number of wallet connections for Uniswap in the past 30 days", "average daily liquidity provided to Aave in the past 6 months" and so on. When it comes to AI, it is usually based on aggregated data to predict a task like credit score which tasks can be easily standardized.
