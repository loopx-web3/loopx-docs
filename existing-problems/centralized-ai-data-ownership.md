# Centralized AI and Data Ownership

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

AI technology and data application development is at the risks of:

* Centralized Ownership. Currently, AI technologies are owned by the most powerful tech companies. The data is contributed by everyone but only the biggest companies retain the most financial benefits.
* Privileged Access. Meanwhile, only the most privileged ones have access to the large AI models and the data. The model development is controlled by organizations with the most resources. The mass public does not have control over the AI technology development.
* Government Censorship. It is imperative to have a decentralized platform for everyone to develop, contribute and earn in the process of AI development.

User data is subject to privacy and ownership issues, under the control of Web2 big tech companies. Users contribute the data, while Web2 companies retain the financial benefits.
