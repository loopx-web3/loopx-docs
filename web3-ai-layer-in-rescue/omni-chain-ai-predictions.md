## Omni-chain through Bridge

AI model predictions are published multi-chain with [Wormhole Network](https://wormhole.com/). Wormhole is a generic interoperability protocol, and also an ecosystem and platform for developers to grow the decentralized computing space. Wormhole consists of multiple modular swap-in components that can be leveraged independently and supports an increasing number of composable applications built by numerous teams. Wormhole is live on mainstream EVM and non-EVM chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, Near, Solana, Aptos, Injective and so on.
