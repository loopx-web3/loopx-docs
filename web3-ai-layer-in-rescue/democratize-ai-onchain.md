## Vision

LoopX Network is to:

* **democratize AI** for contributions from and rewards to the mass public,
* **bring AI on-chain** for the public access and privacy, and
* **fully decentralize** the data collection, model learning and application integrations.

## Mission

LoopX is to provide censorship resistance, public access and ownership for the AI development. It is a hardware coordination layer for compute resources and data intelligence layer for AI development coordination.

It is a decentralized Web3 data intelligence infrastructure in which users can plug in their local data together with public onchain and offchain data. More enriched decentralized applications and secure multichain Web3 ecosystem can be built on top of it. User behaviors, wallet profiles and protocol forensics are learned and propagated in the network in a privacy preserving manner to empower data driven DApps and build digital asset security and risk management.

It builds the fundamental Web3 data intelligence layer for on-chain security, digital asset management, next generation social networking, targeted user growth, decentralized Web3 content distribution, identity, reputation, personalized recommendation and fully decentralized data ownership. Data ownership is given back to users, while data analytics and intelligence capacities are maintained by LoopX Network in a fully decentralized manner. The learned behaviors are accessible through smart contracts in LoopX network or any other blockchain in privacy preserving manner.

LoopX northstar is a _**decentralized AI infrastructure for everyone to build, connect and earn**_. The technical details are illustrated in the [whitepaper](https://www.loopx.network/whitepaper.pdf).
