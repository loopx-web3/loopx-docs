# Boundless and Standardized Data

To increase data coverage, data publishers can update data to the network for Web3 data. For Web2 data, users share the data in a privacy preserving manner with LoopX chrome extension app. Data and computations are standardized and reliable with the following solutions:

* **No Code Pipelines.** Standard schemas are defined for consistency, no code aggregation logic and AI model usages.
* **Data Validations.** Each data input has multiple data sources. The data is cross verified with anomaly detection for reliability.
* **Standardized Tasks.** AI models are built for standardized tasks (e.g., wallet credit score, wallet interest tagging). It is used for easy DApp and blockchain  integrations.
