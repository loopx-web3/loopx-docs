# ðŸ“– Architecture Overview

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled Diagram-1681092753664.drawio.svg" alt=""><figcaption><p>High level architecture. Analytics publisher, client consumer, substrate network and onchain contracts are the key design components.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Analytics Publisher

Analytics publishers push analytics data such as machine learning model features to the substrate network. It is consumed from analytics store generated by data aggregation platform.

* The analytics stores are usually offline data stores like HDFS and S3, online data stores such as DynamoDB, MySQL and Kafka, and streaming data stores like Kafka.
* The aggregation platforms are typically designed with batch data pipelines, Spark jobs, and Flink streaming pipelines.
* The aggregation logic can be customized with configs for count, key aggregation and other SQL-like operations.

## Client Consumers

The client consumers query and download on-chain data for application development such as transaction visibility and analytics dashboard.

## Onchain Contracts

Onchain contracts are blockchain interfaces for publishers and consumers.

## Substrate Network

The substrate network is the fundamental LoopX Network overlay layer. It is integrated with Tensorflow AI framework for AI model supports.
